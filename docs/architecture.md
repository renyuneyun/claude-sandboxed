# How it works

## Overview

1. The launcher parses its own options, one optional workspace, and the exact arguments following `--`.
2. It resolves the workspace, config files, and mirrored container identity.
3. It selects a profile using CLI `--tool` > `SANDBOX_TOOL` > workspace `tool` > user `tool` > Claude.
4. The profile chooses its npm package, host-derived or pinned version, autonomy flag, optional API key, and read/write config binds.
5. The launcher assembles conditional read-only git-config binds, identity overrides, and an optional generated read-only policy bind.
6. It runs `docker compose run --rm`, starting a fresh `ai-agent` container in the per-UID Compose project.
7. The root entrypoint creates the mirrored user/group when needed, configures push protection, drops privileges, and execs the selected coding agent.
8. The selected coding agent works in the bind-mounted workspace under the git wrapper policy. The container is removed on exit; named volumes persist.
9. When enabled and applicable, a one-shot `cleanup` container removes empty mount-point parent stubs; the generated policy file is removed by the launcher exit trap.

Claude receives `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; Codex receives `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. The container limits the blast radius while the selected coding agent operates autonomously.

Multiple sessions can run in parallel. Per-user project naming (`claude-sandboxed-${SANDBOX_UID}`) isolates different host UIDs; Claude and Codex sessions for one UID share the same `claude-agent-home` named volume.

## Network isolation

**Current status: no network isolation.** The container uses `network_mode: host`, meaning it shares the host's network namespace. This was chosen for simplicity and allows the container to reach host-local services such as a proxy at `127.0.0.1:1080`.

Host networking provides reachability but does not copy host proxy settings or force traffic through a proxy. The launcher separately builds `PROXY_ENV_ARGS` from non-empty standard host proxy variables when `proxy.env_passthrough` is enabled, then passes those arguments to `docker compose run` before `npx` starts.

Improving network isolation is a planned future goal. The current focus is on filesystem and git-level sandboxing.

## Volume layout and lifecycle

| Mount | Scope | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace bind | Selected project | Host files persist; container is ephemeral |
| `claude-agent-home` named volume | Host UID | Shared across tools/workspaces/sessions until Docker removal |
| Tool-config bind | Host user by default; configurable per workspace | Host files persist; read/write |
| Git-config bind | Host user | Host files persist; read-only in container |
| Generated policy bind | One launcher invocation | Temporary host file removed by exit trap; read-only |
| Git-wrapper bind | Package installation | Persists with installation; read-only |

The tool-config bind targets `${SANDBOX_HOME}/.claude` and `${SANDBOX_HOME}/.claude.json` for Claude, or `${SANDBOX_HOME}/.codex` for Codex. Each can be disabled independently. Bind mounts follow their host files' lifecycle; unlike them, the Docker-managed named volume outlives each ephemeral container.

## Container environment

The sandbox marker is always set. The selected profile's API key and enabled generic proxy variables are forwarded only when present:

| Variable | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IS_SANDBOX=1` | Hard-coded | Signals that the selected coding agent runs inside the external sandbox |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Host environment (Claude, if set) | Authenticates Claude without host config |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Host environment (Codex, if set) | Authenticates Codex without host config |
| `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` | Host environment (if non-empty and passthrough enabled) | Configures uppercase-aware proxy clients |
| `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `all_proxy`, `no_proxy` | Host environment (if non-empty and passthrough enabled) | Configures lowercase-aware proxy clients |

Proxy environment passthrough is tool-neutral and defaults to enabled. `SANDBOX_PROXY_ENV_PASSTHROUGH` / `proxy.env_passthrough` can disable it. Uppercase and lowercase forms are independent and values are forwarded unchanged; proxy URLs are not stored in YAML.

## Root user mode

When `SANDBOX_UID=0` the entrypoint skips user and group creation and does not call `runuser` — the selected coding agent runs directly as root inside the container. This is mainly useful for CI environments where the container already runs as root.

## Git config inheritance

The host user's `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.config/git/` are bind-mounted into the container at the corresponding paths under `$SANDBOX_HOME`, read-only. Mounts are conditional: if the host path does not exist, the mount is skipped (git uses defaults). Read-only prevents the selected coding agent from modifying the host's git config.

Git config precedence is system < global, so a user's `~/.gitconfig` could override `core.sshCommand` set via `git config --system`. This is acceptable because `git push` is blocked at the wrapper level (see below), and the threat model is accidental damage, not adversarial bypass.

## Git operation policy

A wrapper script at `share/claude-sandboxed/git-wrapper` is bind-mounted to `/usr/local/bin/git` in the container (read-only). The `node:22-bookworm` image's default `PATH` has `/usr/local/bin` before `/usr/bin`, so `git` invocations hit the wrapper. The wrapper parses argv, applies a blocklist of destructive subcommands plus flag-level checks on allowed subcommands, then `exec`s `/usr/bin/git` for allowed commands.

The wrapper does **not** strip user-supplied `-c` flags or `GIT_CONFIG_*` env vars. The defense is that push is blocked at the subcommand level, and `~/.gitconfig` is read-only.

**Bypass via `/usr/bin/git` directly is a known limitation.** See `docs/tradeoffs.md`.

### Blocked operations

- **Fully blocked subcommands:** `push`, `reset`, `rebase`, `filter-branch`, `filter-repo`, `clean`, `config`
- **Conditionally blocked:** `reflog expire|delete`, `notes remove|prune`, `worktree remove|prune`, `stash drop|clear`, `branch -D|--delete --force` (force delete; safe `-d`/`--delete` allowed), `tag -f|--force` (force; safe `-d`/`--delete` allowed)
- **Flag-level blocks:** `commit --amend|--reset-author`, `checkout -B|-f|--force|-- <pathspec>`, `switch -C|--discard-changes`, `restore --worktree|-W`, `rm` (without `--cached`), `gc --prune`

### Defense in depth

Two independent layers block `git push`:

1. Entrypoint sets `git config --system core.sshCommand ...` and `url.insteadOf` rules (existing).
2. Wrapper blocks `git push` at the subcommand level (new).

Either failing leaves the other working.
